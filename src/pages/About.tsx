              <p>
                My Schoolwear Hub was founded in 2015 with a simple mission: to help schools create sportswear that truly represents their spirit and identity. 
                What started as a small operation has grown into a trusted partner for schools nationwide.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                We understand that school sportswear is more than just clothing â€“ it's a symbol of pride, unity, and belonging. 
                That's why we put so much care into every item we produce, from design to delivery.
              </p>
